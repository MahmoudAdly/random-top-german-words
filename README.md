# Random top German words

This is a basic Python script to learn German words by randomly printing words from different word corpses which are already cleaned and prepared (top 5k, top 10k... etc).

## How to use

1. Simply clone the project and run

  ```
  $ cd random-top-german-words
  $ python random-top-german-words.py
  ```

2. You will be greeted by a menu of different word corpses. Write the number of the option your want and press ENTER.
3. New words will keep getting printed in your console as long as you keep pressing ENTER.
4. Press CTRL+C to exit. (or type anything and press ENTER)
